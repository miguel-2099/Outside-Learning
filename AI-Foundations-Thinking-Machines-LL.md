Artificial Intelligence Foundations: Thinking Machines

Chapter 1: What is Artificial Intelligence?
  Define General Intelligence:
    • AI: Any system that exhibits behavior that could be interpreted as human intelligence.

  The History of AI: 
    • Combinatorial Explosions: A situation where the number of possible combinations or outcomes grows rapidly as the size of the problem or the number of variables increases.

  Strong vs. Weak AI:
    • Strong AI: Machine displays all person-like behavior. Artificial Beings that have emotions, a sense of purpose, and can even tell jokes, may be almost sarcastic.
    • Weak AI/Narrow AI: Machine is confined to a very superficial/narrow task.

  Plan AI: 
    • Planning Artificial Intelligence: When you still have to plan out how to match symbols and patterns.


Chapter 2: The Rise of Machine Learning | Chapter 3: Finding the Right Approach
  Machine Learning | Data Reasoning: 
    • Symbolic Reasoning: Abstract problem, but know the steps for resolution. (Long setup and no outside data).
    • Machine Learning: Look for patterns, to come up with the likeliest answer. (Lots of data that needs tweaking/updating).


Chapter 4: Common AI Problems
  Natural Language Processing:
    • Natural Language Processing: When you interact with a machine using your natural language.

  The Internet of Things/IoT:
    • IoT: The collective network of connected devices and the technology that facilitates communication between devices and the cloud, as well as between the devices themselves.

Chapter 5: Mixing with Other Technologies
  Big Data: 
    • Think of it as a driver for Machine Learning. Machine Learning needs these massive data sets as a way to find patterns.
    • Big data is about managing and analyzing massive datasets.
    • Many specialists use Machine Learning and data mining interchangeably.
    • Data Mining: A broad term in which you look to the data to find new insights.
    • The big difference between ML and DM is the technology used to find these insights:
      ML: Requires training and framework (training your machine to find patterns).
      DM: Uses broader tools without required training (digging through data to find valuable insights).
    • The key to working with a big dataset is thinking differently about the data. Creating training sets and readjusting the weights on their artificial neural network. 
    
  Data Science: 
    • Data Science falls in the knowledge of programming, data, math, statistics, and hacking.

Chapter 6: What Has Changed?
  Generative AI:
    • Instead of just analyzing data, these new systems can generate new data (articles, produce images, develop videos, create complex chatbots, etc.).
    • Newer generative AI systems still use a form of Machine Learning. 
    • The challenge is that most current AI systems have only been designed for one task.
    • How do Machine Learning and AI work together?
      • Deep Learning Artificial Neural Network:
        • A foundation model allows neural networks to be able to handle more than one task without retraining. Meaning, you could create a neural network that both plays video games and looks for credit card fraud.
        • The challenge is that these foundation models is that they have an enormous appetite for data. The foundation model will have to include all of this, that, and even more.
        • To train these systems, you'll have to use something called self-supervised learning. A mix of both unsupervised and supervised learning, this way you can train your system without depending on humans to organize all that data.

  Foundation Models:
    • If you feed the system enough data then it could create a foundation model that wouldn't need retraining. The system would start to find patterns, the foundation model would understand and categorize the data with the patterns it recognizes.
    • If you gather enough data you can develop systems that mix and create data in innovative new ways.

  Self-Supervised Learning:
    • Created with the best aspects of unsupervised and supervised learning. The unsupervised learning will cluster all the similar data. Then the foundation model will use this form of supervised machine learning to look through these clusters 
    and create labels. Then the foundation model will use these labels when creating text. 


Chapter 7: Avoiding Pitfalls
  Pitfalls:
    • Does the program require *Abstract Reasoning or **Detailed Pattern Matching?
    • *: Decisions, actions, and symbols.
    • **: Classify massive amounts of data or find key relationships.
