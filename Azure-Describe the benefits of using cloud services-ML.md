Unit 1/7 to 2/7:
  - Intro and Describe the benefits of high availability and scalability in the cloud:
    - High availability: It focuses on ensuring maximum availability, regardless of disruptions or events that may occur. Azure provides uptime guaranteesthrough SLAs (Service-Level Agreements).
    - Scalability: It's the ability to adjust resources to meet demand, so you can add more resources to better handle the increased demand if you suddenly experience peak traffic and systems are overwhelmend. The other benefit of scalability is that you aren't overpaying for services, because the cloud is a consumption-based model, you only pay for what you use.
    - Scalability generally comes in two varieties: vertical and horizontal. Vertical scaling is focused on increasing or decreasing the capabilities of resources. Horizontal scaling is adding or subtracting the number of resources.
      - Vertical scaling: If you are developing an app and you needed more processing power, you could vertically scale up to add more CPUs or RAM to the virtual machine. Conversely, if you realized you had over-specified the needs, you could vertically scale down by lowering the CPU or RAM specifications.
      - Horizontal scaling: If you suddenly experienced a steed jump in demand, your deployed resources could be scaled out automatically or manually. #(i.e.: you could add additional virtual machines or containers, scaling out. In the same manner, if there was a significant drop in demand, deployed resources could be scaled in (either automatically or manually), scaling in.)#
