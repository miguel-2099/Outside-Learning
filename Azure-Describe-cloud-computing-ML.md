# [Microsoft Azure Fundamentals: Describe cloud concepts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/microsoft-azure-fundamentals-describe-cloud-concepts/)

- Unit 1/8: 
  - Introduction to MS Azure Fundamentals:
    MS Azure is a cloud computing platform with a set of services to help build solutions to meet business' goals, which supports from simple to complex targets. It has simple web services for hosting the business in the cloud. Azure provides services like remote storage, database hosting, and centralized account management.


- Unit 2/8 to 3/8:
  - Introduction to cloud computing/ What is cloud computing:
    Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet, like common IT infrastructure, virtual machines, storage, databases, and networking. Cloud services also expand the traditional IT services to include things like IoT, Machine Learning, and AI services.
    Because cloud computing doesn't have to be constrained by a physical infrastructure the same way with a traditional datacenter, it uses the internet to deliver these services. In a way, if you need to increase your infrasctructure rapidly, you don't have to wait to build a new datacenter, you can use the cloud to expand your IT footprint. (Compute power: how much processing your computer can do.)

- Unit 4/8: 
  - Describe the shared responsibility model:
    - With an on-prem/on-premises datacenter, you're responsible for everything, and with cloud computing, those responsabilities shift, and the model idea is sharing responsabilities between the cloud provider and the consumer.
    
    - When using a cloud provider, you'll always be responsible for:
        - Data and information are stored in the cloud.
        - Allowed devices that can connect to your cloud (cell phones, computers, and so on).
        - Accounts and identities of people, services, and devices within the organization.
    - The cloud provider will always be responsible for:
        - The physical datacenter.
        - The physical network.
        - The physical hosts.
    - The service model will determine responsibility for things like:         
        - Operating systems.
        - Network controls.
        - Applications.
        - Identity and infrastructure.
     
- Unit 5/8:
  - Define cloud models:
    - Private cloud: In some ways, it's the natural evolution from a corporate datacenter. It provides much greater control for the company and its IT department, but is does come with greater cost and fewer benefits than a public cloud deployment. It may be hosted on your on-prem datacenter, or a dedicated datacenter offsite, even by a third party that has dedicated that datacenter to your company.
    - Public cloud: It's built, controlled, and maintained by a third-party cloud provider. Anyone who wants to purchase the cloud services can access and use resources. The general public availability is a key difference between public and private clouds.
    - Hybrid Cloud: It's a computing environment that uses both public and private clouds in an interconnected environment. It allows a private cloud to surge for increased, temporary demand by deploying public cloud resources. Also, it can provide an extra layer of security.
    - Multi-cloud: You deal with two (or more) public cloud providers and manage resources and security in both enviroments. You may use multiple cloud providers and different features, or you started your cloud journey with one provider and are in the process of migration to a different provider.
    - Azure Arc: It's a set of technologies that helps manage cloud enviroments. Also, it can manage your cloud enviroment, whether it's a public cloud solely on Azure, a private cloud in your datacenter, a hybrid configuration, or even a multi-cloud enviromnent running on multiple cloud providers at once.
    - Azure VMware Solution: It lets you run your VMware workloads in Azure with seamless integration and scalability.
   
- Unit 6/8:
  - Describe the consumption-based model:
    - There are two types of expenser to consider when comparing IT infrastructure models: Capital expenditure (CapEx) and operational expenditure (OpEx). Cloud computing falls under OpEx because cloud computing operates on a consumption-based model, so you don't pay for the physical infrastructure, electricity, security, or anything else associated with maintaining a datacenter. Instead, you pay for the IT resources you use.
    - CapEx is a one-time, up-front expenditure to purchase a set of tangible resources. (i.e.: a new building, repaving the parking lot, building a datacenter, or byuing a company vehicle).
    - OpEx is over time expennditure on services or products. (i.e.: Renting a convention center, leasing a company vehicle, or signing up for cloud services).
