Unit 1/6 and 2/6:
  - Intro and Describe Infrastructure as a Service:
    - Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is the most flexible category of cloud services, as it provides you the maximum amount of control for your cloud resources. In an IaaS model, the cloud provider is responsible for maintaining the hardware, network connectivity (to the internet), and physical security. You're responsible for everything else: OS installation, configuration, and maintenance; network configuration; database and storage configuration; and so on. With IaaS, you're essentially renting the hardware in a cloud datacenter, but what you do with that hardware is up to you.
      - [Shared responsibility model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/media/shared-responsibility/shared-responsibility.svg): This model applies to all the cloud services. IaaS places the largest shared responsibility with you. The cloud provider is responsible for maintaining the physical infrastructure and its access to the internet. You're responsible for installation and configuration, patching and updates, and security.

Unit 3/6:
  - Describe Platform as a Service:
    - Platform as a service (PaaS) is a middle ground between renting a space in a datacenter (infrastructure as a service/IaaS) and paying for a complete deployment solution (software as a service/SaaS). In a PaaS environment, the cloud provider maintains the physical infrastructure, physical security, and connection to the internet. They also maintain the OS, middleware, development tools, and business intelligence services that make up a cloud solution. In a PaaS scenario, you don't have to worry about the licensing or patching for operating systems and databases.
    - PaaS is well-suited to provide a complete development environment without the headache of maintaining all the development infrastructure.

Unit 4/6:
  - Describe Software as a Service:
    - Software as a service (SaaS) is the most complete cloud service model from a product perspective. With SaaS, you're essentially renting or using a fully developed application. Email, financial software, and messaging applications. and connectivity software are all common examples of SaaS implementation.
