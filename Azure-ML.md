# [Microsoft Azure Fundamentals: Describe cloud concepts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/microsoft-azure-fundamentals-describe-cloud-concepts/)

- Unit 1/8: 
  - Introduction to MS Azure Fundamentals:
    MS Azure is a cloud computing platform with a set of services to help build solutions to meet business' goals, which supports from simple to complex targets. It has simple web services for hosting the business in the cloud. Azure provides services like remote storage, database hosting, and centralized account management.


- Unit 2/8 to 3/8:
  - Introduction to cloud computing/ What is cloud computing:
    Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet, like common IT infrastructure, virtual machines, storage, databases, and networking. Cloud services also expand the traditional IT services to include things like IoT, Machine Learning, and AI services.
    Because cloud computing doesn't have to be constrained by a physical infrastructure the same way with a traditional datacenter, it uses the internet to deliver these services. In a way, if you need to increase your infrasctructure rapidly, you don't have to wait to build a new datacenter, you can use the cloud to expand your IT footprint. (Compute power: how much processing your computer can do.)

- Unit 4/8: 
  - Describe the shared responsability model:
    - With an on-prem/on-premises datacenter, you're responsible for everything, and with cloud computing those responsabilities shift and the model idea is sharing responsabilities between the cloud provider and the consumer.
    
    - When using a cloud provider, you'll always be responsible for:
        - Data and information stored in the cloud.
        - Allowed devices that can connect to your cloud (cell phones, computer, and so on).
        - Accounts and identities of people, services and devices withing the organization.
    - The cloud provider will always be responsible for:
        - The physical datacenter.
        - The physical network.
        - The physical hosts.
    - The service model will determine responsbilit for things like:         
        - Operating systems.
        - Network controls.
        - Applications.
        - Identity and infrastructure.
     
- Unit 5/8:
  - Define cloud models:
      - Private cloud: In some ways, it's the natural evolution from a corporate datacenter. It provides much greater control for the company and its IT department, but is does come with greater cost and fewer benefits of a publid cloud deployemnt. It may be hosted on your on-prem datacenter, or a dedicated datacenter offsite, even by a thrid party that has dedicated that datacenter to your company.
      - Public cloud: It's built, controlled, and maintained by a third-party cloud provider. Anyone that wants to purchase the cloud services can access and use resources. The general public availability is a key difference between public and private clouds.
      - Hybrid Cloud: It's a computing enviroment that uses both public and private clouds in an inter-connected enviroment. It allows a private cloud to surge for increasted, temporary demand by deploying public cloud resources. Also, it can provide an extra layer of security.
      - Multi-cloud:
