  Introduction to cloud computing/ What is cloud computing:
    Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet, like common IT infrastructure, virtual machines, storage, databases, and networking. Cloud services also expand the traditional IT services to include things like IoT, Machine Learning, and AI services.
    Because cloud computing doesn't have to be constrained by a physical infrastructure the same way with a traditional datacenter, it uses the internet to deliver these services. In a way, if you need to increase your infrasctructure rapidly, you don't have to wait to build a new datacenter, you can use the cloud to expand your IT footprint.
    Compute power: how much processing your computer can do.
