Course Description: This course introduces the pivotal role of embedded systems in automotive technology. It starts with foundational concepts and progresses through the design, development, and implementation of these systems within vehicles. Learners will explore microcontrollers, software development, sensor integration, and the enhancement of vehicle functionality, safety, and performance through embedded systems. Real-world examples and case studies will illustrate how embedded systems are transforming the automotive industry.

Lesson 1: Introduction to Embedded Systems in Automotive
  - Module 1: Course and Instructor Intro | Module 2: The Essence of Embedded Systems in Automotive
    - What is an embedded system? 
      - A specialized computer system engineered to perform specific and dedicated functions within a larger mechanical or electrical framework.
      - Handle multiple functions, such as control of headlights, wipers, executing complex algorithms essential for autonomous driving, and adaptive cruise control, to enhance overall functionality, efficiency, and safety of vehicles through integration with automotive hardware.
  - Key Components of Automotive Embedded Systems:
    - Microcontrollers: Controls functions such as engine management, airbags, and anti-lock braking systems (ABS).
    - Actuator: Performs physical actions based on commands from the microcontroller, like turning the AC on.
    - Embedded Software: It tells the system how to react in different situations based on the data received.
    - Communication Systems: Allows different parts of the car to communicate with each other and with external devices like smartphones or diagnostic tools.
