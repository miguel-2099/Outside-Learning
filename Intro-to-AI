Notes for Intro to Artificial Intelligence

Chapter 1: What is AI? Define General Intelligence (1.1)

• Computer Intelligence and Human Intelligence start from very different places.

Chapter 2: The Rise of Machine Learning: Machine Learning (2.1)
• Program a system to become intelligent through observation, by sensing data, and by learning through data. Machines could continue to grow with more data.

Artificial Neural Networks (2.2):
• Artificial Neural Network: AI System that mimics the structure of the human brain; The artificial neural network uses hundreds (or millions) of numerical dials.
