    â€¢ Computer Intelligence and Human Intelligence start from very different places.


Chapter 2: The Rise of Machine Learning
  Machine Learning:
    â€¢ Program a system to become intelligent through observation, by sensing data, and by learning through data. Machines could continue to grow with more data.

  Artificial Neural Networks:
    â€¢ Artificial Neural Network: AI System that mimics the structure of the human brain; The artificial neural network uses hundreds (or millions) of numerical dials.

Chapter 3: Common AI Systems
  Build a Neural Network:
    â€¢ Machine Learning feeds on data to learn new things.
    â€¢ Natural language processing gives the machine the ability to understand the larger world.


Chapter 4: Learn From Data
  Labeled and Unlabeled Data: 
    â€¢ How a machine learns?
      Approach 1:                                                                                      |   Approach 2: 
        Supervised Learning: A data scientist acts like a tutor for the machine. They show the correct |     Unsupervised Learning: The machine does all observations by itself. The machine might not
        answers and lets the system train itself to get better at the game.                            |     know all names and/or labels, but it'll figure out on their own to learn from data.


  Massive Datasets: 
    â€¢ Split data into a Training Set* and Test Set**:
      *Training Data Set: A smaller chunk of data that the machine uses to learn (statistics, relationships within data).
      **Test Data Set: Many times larger than Training Data Set. It lets the machine identify labels and patterns (categorization/classification). 


Chapter 5: Identify Patterns
  Classify Data: 
    â€¢ Supervised Learning (depends on labeled data): The system needs a knowledgeable tutor. Someone who knows (classifying) a lot about the matter and the how-to's. 
    â€¢ Unsupervised Learning: The system needs a lot of data or access to a lot of data (clustering).

  Cluster Data: 
    â€¢ Data Clusters: AI system's use of unsupervised learning to create its own groups of data (similarities/recommendations).

  Reinforced Learning: 
    â€¢ Machine Learning algorithms that use rewards as a way to give the system incentive to find new patterns.
    â€¢ Q-Learning: Reinforced learning that enables a model to iteratively learn and improve over time by taking the correct action.


Chapter 6: Machine Learning Algorithms
  KNN / K Nearest Neighbor: An algorithm that plots new data and compares it to existing data.
    â€¢ Euclidean Distance: a mathematical formula that helps see the distance between data points.
  K-Means Clustering: 
    â€¢ Unsupervised machine learning algorithm. It's used to create clusters based on what the machine sees in the data. 
  Regression Analysis: 
    â€¢ A supervised Machine Learning algorithm that looks at predictions and the outcome (training data and labeling correct output, then, you're using the labeled data with the test data). 
    * Once you have your training data, you make a prediction, then you see how close you're to the outcome; and repeat. The more data you have available the easier it is to make an accurate trend line.

  Naive Bayes:
    â€¢ Algorithm that assumes that all the predictors are independent from one another.


Chapter 7: Fit the Algorithm
  Follow the data: 
    â€¢ Bias and Variance:
        Bias: the gap between the predicted value and the actual outcome (like predicting you'll roll dice 3 and get a 5, but you rolled a 4, 3 times. That is equal protection and has high bias, off by one each time).
        Variance: When the prediction values are scattered all over the place (with the same above prediction, but you rolled a 2, 4, and 6, off by different amounts).


Chapter 8: Artificial Neural Networks
  Build a Neural Network:
    â€¢ Artificial Neural Network: A type of Machine Learning that uses a structure like the human brain to break down massive data sets.
  Weighting the Connections:
    â€¢ Weights in the neural network:
      1. Initiate the neural network.
      2. Feed the training data set.
      3. Let the system adjust weights based on outputs.


Chapter 9: Improve Accuracy
  Learning From Mistakes: 
    â€¢ Cost Function: A number that the system uses to measure its answer against the correct answer.
    â€¢ Backpropagation of Errors (backdrop): An algorithm that is designed to test for errors working back from output nodes to input nodes.
    â€¢ Building an AI System:
      1. Figure out what you want from the data.
      2. Determine the type of Machine Learning model you need, *Standard Machine Learning Algorithms or **Artificial Neural Networks. 
      *Standard ML Algorithm: K-Nearest Neighbor and Naive Bayes.
      **ANN: Feed the training set, determine how much to change the weights, and add data from the test set. 

  
Chapter 10: Where to Go from Here
  Using AI Systems: 
    â€¢ AI Systems: 
      1. Are as good as the data they're given.
      2. Learn by trying different things.
      3. Can do things humans can't.

"The organizations that create the best AI systems will be the ones that enhance and not replace human creativity."
